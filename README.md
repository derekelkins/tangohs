This is a reference implementation and visualization of some of the ideas from [Tango: Distributed Data Structures over a Shared Log](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2522732).

See also [https://github.com/derekelkins/tangojs](https://github.com/derekelkins/tangojs) for a JavaScript version that makes some different design decisions and [https://github.com/tomjkidd/tangoclj](https://github.com/tomjkidd/tangoclj) for a Clojure implementation taking a similar approach to this Haskell implementation.

The visualization is available at [https://derekelkins.github.io/tangohs/](https://derekelkins.github.io/tangohs/).  Press 'h' for some basic instructions.
